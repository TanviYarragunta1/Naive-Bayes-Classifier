2. Loading the data.
3. Filter by removing the stopwords like punctuations.
4. Preprocess the data.
5. Divide the dataset into train, test, development(Part a).
6. Build a vocabulary list(Part b).
7. Calculate the probability (Part c).
8. Calculate the accuracy (Part d).
9. Smoothing, Deriving the top 10 words from the vocabulary list (Part e).
10. Calculating the final accuracy (Part f).
